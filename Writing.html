    <h1>A Walk Among The Ruins:</h1>
    <h2>
I walk the abandoned path
 “Fear my power, fear my wraith,
For I am the higher law”

That is the message that our leaders screamed,
 from the top of the world.
 their positions higher then anyone else’s,
Their ego’s bigger then the ruins I now stand upon.

When I look into the cities they have destroyed,
the world they left behind,
and the wraith they had unleashed upon our world,
it is then that I see that the real message should have been;

“Fear my fear, be scared of my humanity.
 For I am not more or less then you,
 for I am yet another human,
tangled in distress,
 blinded by power, greatness and success.”

Mistakes are human, but anger, anger is a sickness.

It shall rise when those who have been hurt,
see no other way out.
It shall rise, when those who had been silenced,
shall speak for their selves.
And it shall rise, when those who had been broken,
get rid of the mashed pieces of what was once their hope.

It’s then when humanity realizes,
that it’s time has come.
Anger shall puppeteer our fate from now on.
And thus, I stand here.
Damned among the dead and forgotten,
among the ruins, now just a memory, left and rotten.</h2>
